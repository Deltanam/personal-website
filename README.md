# Dan Tran's Personal Website

This is the code base for my personal website. This personal website has three main pages: Home, Engineering, and Video Editing.

Home has an introduction and my basic contact info. It also has a beautiful picture of Lake Louise at dawn that I took with my cousins! To get there in time for the dawn, we needed to drive out at 4AM to catch it.

Engineering has a list of select programming projects for software, firmware, and hardware. There are links to each projects' respective Github.

Video editing has a select list of videos that I made for various groups/teams.
